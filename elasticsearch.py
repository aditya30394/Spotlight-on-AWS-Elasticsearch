# Spotlight on Amazon Elasticsearch Service

**Name : Aditya Kumar** 

## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library which uses **BM25** under the hood. Apart from being open-source, tt is distributed in nature meaning it can scale quite easily and works with schema-free JSON documents. To learn more about Lucene and opensource Elasticsearch please do look at the detailed [Lucene and Elasticsearch Spotlight by Minreng](https://github.com/tamucse670/2020.spring.spotlight/blob/master/Minreng%20Wu_Lucene%20and%20Elasticsearch_Feb27.ipynb).

## Amazon Elasticsearch Service

AWS Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service making it easier for developers to deploy Elasticsearch cost effectively at scale. It also provides various security features that you can use to make your APIs secure. The service provides support for open source Elasticsearch APIs, managed Kibana, integration with Logstash and other AWS services, and built-in alerting and SQL querying.

### Benefits

1.   **Easy to deploy and manage** - Be ready in minutes!
2.   **Highly scalable and available** - Upto 3 PB data in a single cluster
3.   **Highly secure** - Isolation using Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) and encryption
4.   **Cost-Effective** - pay for what you use
5.   **Perform search in near real time** - slight latency(~1sec) to index a document 

### Disadvantage

1.   Elasticsearch does not have multi-language support
2.   Works only with JSON unlike Apache Solr which can work with CSV, XML and JSON formats

### Key Concepts

1.  Node - single instance running Elasticsearch
2.  Cluster - a collection of one or more nodes. It is responsible for providing indexing and search capabilities.
3.  Index - a collection of different type of documents and their properties
4.  Document - collection of fields. Basic unit of information that can be indexed.

### Comparison with Relational database

| Elasticsearch | RDBMS |
| --- | --- | 
| Cluster | Collection of Database |
| Shard | Shard |
| Index | Database |
| Type | Table |
| Mapping | Schema |
| Field | Column |
| Document (JSON Object) | Row |
| ID | Primary Key |

## Creating and setting up the cluster
**NOTE: Following these instructions should not cost you anything. Remember to KILL the cluster as soon as you are done.**

1. Login to your AWS account and go to AWS Management Console. Search and select Elasticsearch Service

![page_0.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_0.png?raw=true)

2. You should see a page similar to the one below. Click on create a new domain.
![page_1.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_1.png?raw=true)

3. Select development and test on the next screen.
![page_2.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_2.png?raw=true)

4. Chnage the instance type to **t2.small.elasticsearch**. This is **important if you don't want to be surprised with a bill from Amazon**. Keep the number of nodes to be 1. In actual deployment this will be more than 1.
![page_3.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_3.png?raw=true)

5. For this tutorial don't enable the dedicated master node. Again, in actual deployment you would not do this and will typically have 2-3 master nodes in your cluster.
![page_4.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_4.png?raw=true)

6. Select public access for this tutorial.
![page_5.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_5.png?raw=true)

7. Select Custome access policy and in the dropdown menu select "IPv4 address". Disable the HTTPS encryption too.
![page_6.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_6.png?raw=true)

8. Review the configurations
![page_7.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_7.png?raw=true)

9. Click confirm
![page_8.png](https://github.com/aditya30394/Spotlight-on-AWS-Elasticsearch/blob/master/page_8.png?raw=true)

10. It will take about 10 minutes for the cluster to be ready.

Here we are not interested in the AND operation but we want to score the documents higher if they are batman related. For this sort of requirement, we use **should** keyword which performs operations similar to OR. **match_phrase** does an exact match instead of loose on like match.

Yes, it is quite possible. In the following query, the presence of "batman" in the title is weighted 5 times more than that of "plot".

You can see that the plot of "Batman Vs Superman" doesn't even mention the word batman but because of our weighing scheme, it was scored higher (14.77) compared to "The dark knight rises" which scored much lower (4.51)

## Summary

This spotlight demonstrates how to combine the rapid scaling capabilities of Amazon web services(AWS) with search APIs offered by Elasticsearch. I started off with brief introductions to some key concepts. Then I demonstrated how one should set up the cluster on AWS Elastic service. Finally, I demonstrated the use of APIs.
